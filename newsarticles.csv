Critics argue that GMOs could potentially pose risks to human health and the environment. While Kenya faces legal hurdles in its attempt to import GMOs, Ethiopia takes a proactive approach to GMO adoption by testing genetically modified crops. However, concerns remain over the potential health and environmental risks of GMO products, both in Kenya and Ethiopia.', 'Ethiopia has seen little opposition to GMO adoption due to the lack of strong consumer protection activity in the country. Meanwhile, the ongoing legal battle in Kenya highlights the divide between the pro-GMO government and anti-GMO opposition groups who argue that the government did not consult the public and that GMO products pose health risks.', 'In October 2022, the new administration of William Ruto reversed the Kenyan government’s ten-year ban on consumable GMOs, but the Kenyan high court ruled against the decision a month later. The government appealed, and the appeals court upheld the high court’s verdict in favor of GMO opposition groups in Kenya.', '“We see nothing for the court to preserve and it cannot be said that the substratum of the appeal will be eroded,” ruled the appellate court in Kenya.', 'The Kenyan High Court is also hearing another case filed by the Kenyan Peasant League, a representing body of a social movement. The League opposes the government’s decision to impose GMOs, arguing that allowing their cultivation and consumption is unlawful and that the government did not consult the public. Furthermore, the League asserts that GMO products pose health risks.', 'As a result of the ongoing case, the Kenyan government is prohibited from importing or distributing GMO crops and food until a final verdict is reached. If the Kenyan Peasants League wins the case, the Kenyan government may be permanently banned from importing GMOs.', 'The Kenyan government has argued that adopting biotechnology and using GMOs will significantly help to resolve Kenya’s food security challenges and boost the supply of animal feed. The debate between the pro-GMO Kenyan government and the anti-GMO community in Kenya follows similar lines of argument to those in Ethiopia.', 'In a stark contrast to Kenya, the Ethiopian government is currently testing the adoption of consumable GMOs without opposition. The government is testing GMO maize, wheat, potato, and enset in confined areas within different agricultural research centers, according to an official at the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR).', 'The official, who leads teams of researchers working on GMO adoption, spoke about the progress at an agricultural expo held for weeks at the science museum.

Once proven in confined testing areas, they will be released to farmers. However, authorization from the biosafety regulators at the Environment, Forest and Climate Change Commission is required,” said the official.', 'So far, Ethiopia has authorized commercial purposes only for cotton, and commercial authorization for local cultivation of wheat, maize, potato, and enset is expected. However, experts have concluded that GMO products are already being imported and consumed in Ethiopia, both intentionally and unintentionally.', 'The lack of controlling mechanisms to test GMO and non-GMO commodities upon importation contributes to this unintentional consumption, and there is evidence of GMO items being smuggled into Ethiopia through border areas, mainly from Sudan.', 'Ethiopia adopted the arguable GMO proclamation in 2015, changing Ethiopia’s strict position for the first time.

Opposition and rebel groups appear to be using violence as a way to achieve their political objectives, which has brought renewed attention to the issue of political violence in the country. The prevalence of extrajudicial killings in Ethiopia is not a new phenomenon, dating back to the Red and White Terror episode under the military dictatorship of Dergue in the 1970s and 1980s.', 'However, today, the perpetrators of these killings are predominantly third parties, including individuals with political interests, groups, and other non-state entities.', 'The assassinations of government officials began shortly after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (PhD) assumed office in 2018. During the earliest phases of the political transition, the Prime Minister himself survived a grenade assault while addressing a public rally in Meskel Square. Two months later, the chief engineer of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Simegnew Bekele, was found dead in his car in the same square. In 2019, there were even more shocking killings.', 'Amhara Region’s former President, Ambachew Mekonnen, and Seare Mekonnen (Gen.) were killed on the same date in June 2019.', 'Ambachew, along with his advisor Ezez Wassie, was assassinated in Bahir Dar, the region’s capital, in June 2019. Seare, on the other hand, was killed in Addis Ababa the same day by his own bodyguard, who had apparently turned on him and carried out the attack. The killings in Amhara Region were carried out by a group of soldiers led by Amhara’s head of state security, Asamnew Tsige (Gen.), who had apparently orchestrated the coup attempt in the region.', 'The tragic killing of yet another official from the Amhara Region last month by armed groups operating in the area serves as a bleak reminder that history has a disheartening tendency to repeat itself.', 'The severity of the killing spree is greater in the regional states, but even the capital city has not been immune to the violence. In recent months, a number of high-ranking officials have been assassinated, including the Amhara regional state Prosperity Party leader, Girma Yeshitila, and the Afar region PP leader of Hanruka District, Umer Lema.', 'Of all regions, Oromia is where more officials were killed than any other region in recent years, excluding Tigray, where such violence was common due to the two-year full-fledged war in the region. Last year, it was reported that there was a day when 28 officials were allegedly killed by the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA).', 'The killings of officials in Oromia are often carried out in the context of political tensions and ethnic conflicts in the region. Political groups that claim to represent the Oromo people, who make up the majority of the population in Oromia, have long complained of political marginalization and discrimination. Armed groups such as the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) have emerged in response to these grievances, and they have carried out attacks on government officials and security forces in an effort to advance their political demands.', 'Various organizations and researchers have studied targeted killings of officials in Ethiopia. Research has shown that the targeting of government officials by opposition groups is a symptom of deeper political and social problems, often rooted in weak governance.', 'A study published in 2019 in the Journal of Modern African Studies by Kristian Takvam Kindt and Kjetil Tronvoll found that political violence, including targeted killings of government officials and leaders, had contributed to a culture of fear and mistrust in the country and had undermined social cohesion and political stability.', 'Another study published in 2017 by Lencho Lata and the Institute for Security Studies found that political violence, including targeted killings, had a negative impact on economic growth in Ethiopia as it disrupted supply chains and undermined investor confidence.

He emphasizes that disagreements and differing viewpoints are a natural part of the political process and do not make leadership any harder than it already is.', 'For Mulatu Gemechu, an opposition figure, the recent murders in Ethiopia have a political motive and are a result of the government’s inability to establish law and order. He suggests that the government has failed to use its authority and resources effectively, making it challenging to identify the actual perpetrators of each crime.', 'Mulatu emphasizes that satisfying the interests of the people through a strategy that benefits everyone is key to promoting harmony and security.', 'In contrast, Tiruneh Gemta, the secretary of the Oromo Federalist Congress, blames the ruling party for the current situation in Ethiopia, stating that the government’s transgressions are the primary cause of the country’s current predicament.', '“As an opposition party, we have lost the lives of our members,” says the politician, demanding an investigation by a third party.', 'Tiruneh further argues that the violence has affected not only government officials but also civilians and opposition party leaders who have been targeted because of their political beliefs.

While the IMF is saying creditors’ assurance is required, the creditors committee is saying that IMF approval is required,” an insider who spoke to The Reporter on the condition of anonymity said.', 'The real reason, according to the insider, is the failure of US officials to reach agreement over Ethiopia’s debt restructuring request. “If the US gave its approval, the IMF and creditors committee could immediately process Ethiopia’s request for debt restructuring.”', 'Ethiopia’s request for debt restructuring is being evaluated by the US Treasury Department, State Department, and security agencies, each from a different perspective.', 'The Treasury Department is focused on the financial implications, the State Department on the diplomatic implications, and the security agencies on the national security implications, according to sources.', '“The varying viewpoints among these entities may pose challenges for the US in making a decision on Ethiopia’s request. \xa0Approval from all three is required before the US can grant the request, which may necessitate extensive negotiation and compromise to reach a consensus,” insider said.', '“As the US nears its election, it is unlikely that these three departments agree, unless they do it sooner. This is because US Africa policy and foreign relations would take center stage during the campaigns,” the insider added.', 'The current Ethiopian government prefers the Republicans to win, according to the insider.', '“The Ethiopian government is unhappy with the Democrats.

The appellate court declined the government’s appeal until the interests of the public are heard.', 'On Thursday, May 25, 2023, a panel of three appellate judges, including Justice Mohammed Warsame, Ali Aroni, and John Mativo, stated the application by Kenya’s Attorney General Justin Muturi “lacked merit,” adding that “the public interest test was not met,” according to local media.', 'The use of GMOs has been controversial in many African nations, including Kenya. Critics argue that GMOs could potentially pose risks to human health and the environment. While Kenya faces legal hurdles in its attempt to import GMOs, Ethiopia takes a proactive approach to GMO adoption by testing genetically modified crops. However, concerns remain over the potential health and environmental risks of GMO products, both in Kenya and Ethiopia.', 'Ethiopia has seen little opposition to GMO adoption due to the lack of strong consumer protection activity in the country. Meanwhile, the ongoing legal battle in Kenya highlights the divide between the pro-GMO government and anti-GMO opposition groups who argue that the government did not consult the public and that GMO products pose health risks.', 'In October 2022, the new administration of William Ruto reversed the Kenyan government’s ten-year ban on consumable GMOs, but the Kenyan high court ruled against the decision a month later. The government appealed, and the appeals court upheld the high court’s verdict in favor of GMO opposition groups in Kenya.', '“We see nothing for the court to preserve and it cannot be said that the substratum of the appeal will be eroded,” ruled the appellate court in Kenya.', 'The Kenyan High Court is also hearing another case filed by the Kenyan Peasant League, a representing body of a social movement. The League opposes the government’s decision to impose GMOs, arguing that allowing their cultivation and consumption is unlawful and that the government did not consult the public. Furthermore, the League asserts that GMO products pose health risks.', 'As a result of the ongoing case, the Kenyan government is prohibited from importing or distributing GMO crops and food until a final verdict is reached. If the Kenyan Peasants League wins the case, the Kenyan government may be permanently banned from importing GMOs.', 'The Kenyan government has argued that adopting biotechnology and using GMOs will significantly help to resolve Kenya’s food security challenges and boost the supply of animal feed. The debate between the pro-GMO Kenyan government and the anti-GMO community in Kenya follows similar lines of argument to those in Ethiopia.', 'In a stark contrast to Kenya, the Ethiopian government is currently testing the adoption of consumable GMOs without opposition. The government is testing GMO maize, wheat, potato, and enset in confined areas within different agricultural research centers, according to an official at the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR).', 'The official, who leads teams of researchers working on GMO adoption, spoke about the progress at an agricultural expo held for weeks at the science museum.

Once proven in confined testing areas, they will be released to farmers. However, authorization from the biosafety regulators at the Environment, Forest and Climate Change Commission is required,” said the official.', 'So far, Ethiopia has authorized commercial purposes only for cotton, and commercial authorization for local cultivation of wheat, maize, potato, and enset is expected. However, experts have concluded that GMO products are already being imported and consumed in Ethiopia, both intentionally and unintentionally.', 'The lack of controlling mechanisms to test GMO and non-GMO commodities upon importation contributes to this unintentional consumption, and there is evidence of GMO items being smuggled into Ethiopia through border areas, mainly from Sudan.', 'Ethiopia adopted the arguable GMO proclamation in 2015, changing Ethiopia’s strict position for the first time.
